plot first city
remove first city from cityList

calculate distance between first city and every city in cityList:
	city thisCity = firstCity;
	float currentBestDistance = 0.0;
	float a = 0.0;
	city cityToAdd;
	
	for (city in cityList) {
		// case: first city
		if (currentBestDistance == 0.0)
			currentBestDistance = getRouteDistance(thisCity, cityList[i]);
		else {
			// if this route is more efficient, it's our route and this may be the city to add to currentlyPlottedCities
			a = getRouteDistance(thisCity, cityList[i]);
			if (currentBestDistance < a) {
				currentBestDistance = a;
				cityToAdd = cityList[i];
			}
		}
	}

take smallest distance, and add that city to currentlyPlottedCities and plot that city
remove that city from cityList
repeat, while (!cityList.empty()) 

for every plot, generate a .sh file
populated with a string concatenated with the current list of cities

close the graph window after it's been plotted!
